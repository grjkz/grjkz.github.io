	<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p> 
			My name is Philip Choi and I was born and raised in NYC. I graduated from college and went to work in Japan for two years before returning to America once again to seek a career. 
		</p>

	<h1> Interests </h1>
		<p> 
			My hobbies mostly revolve around video games. My favorite genres are RPG and action. I am also great at first person shooters but I prefer to play them on the PC. My other hobbies include eating good food, bowling, snowboarding, handball, biking/cycling, and kyudo (Japanese archery).
		</p>

	<h1> Goal </h1>
		<p>
			I look forward to learning more about web development and improving myself. I may be more interested in learning back-end rather than front-end but overall, I enjoy learning new and interesting things.
